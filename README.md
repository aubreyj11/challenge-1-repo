## Technologies Used
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
</ul>    

## Description
This website gives more information about Horiseon and different tools one can use. I implemented more accessibility features into it so that images and icons have alt attributes and elements are written semantically. I learned that when some div elements are changed to semantic elements, it can change the layout of the page and in order to fix it one must change the css to match the html changes. 

## Usage 
To use this website, simply click on the options in the navigation bar at the top to be taken to the section corresponding with which nav button you clicked. In the sections you will find more information about each topic.
